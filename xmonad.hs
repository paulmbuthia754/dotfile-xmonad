  This is my xmonad configuration file.
  There are many like it, but this one is mine.

  If you want to customize this file, the easiest workflow goes
  something like this:
    1. Make a small change.
    2. Hit "super-q", which recompiles and restarts xmonad
    3. If there is an error, undo your change and hit "super-q" again to
       get to a stable place again.
    4. Repeat

  Workspace configuration. Here you can change the names of your
  workspaces. Note that they are organized in a grid corresponding
  to the layout of the number pad.

  I would recommend sticking with relatively brief workspace names
  because they are displayed in the xmobar status bar, where space
  can get tight. Also, the workspace labels are referred to elsewhere
  in the configuration file, so when you change a label you will have
  to find places which refer to it and make a change there as well.

  This central organizational concept of this configuration is that
  the workspaces correspond to keys on the number pad, and that they
  are organized in a grid which also matches the layout of the number pad.
  So, I don't recommend changing the number of workspaces unless you are
  prepared to delve into the workspace navigation keybindings section
  as well.

  Layout configuration. In this section we identify which xmonad

  Note that all layouts are wrapped within "avoidStruts". What this does
  is make the layouts avoid the status bar area at the top of the screen.
  Without this, they would overlap the bar. You can toggle this behavior
  by hitting "super-b" (bound to ToggleStruts in the keyboard bindings
  in the next section).

  Custom keybindings. In this section we define a list of relatively
  straightforward keybindings. This would be the clearest place to
  add your own keybindings, or change the keys we have defined
  for certain functions.

  It can be difficult to find a good list of keycodes for use
  in xmonad. I have found this page useful -- just look
  for entries beginning with "xK":

  http://xmonad.org/xmonad-docs/xmonad/doc-index-X.html

  Note that in the example below, the last three entries refer
  to nonstandard keys which do not have names assigned by
  xmonad. That's because they are the volume and mute keys
  on my laptop, a Lenovo W520.

  If you have special keys on your keyboard which you
  want to bind to specific actions, you can use the "xev"
  command-line tool to determine the code for a specific key.
  Launch the command, then type the key in question and watch
  the output.

  Management hooks. You can use management hooks to enforce certain
  behaviors when specific programs or windows are launched. This is
  useful if you want certain windows to not be managed by xmonad,
  or sent to a specific workspace, or otherwise handled in a special
  way.

  Each entry within the list of hooks defines a way to identify a
  window (before the arrow), and then how that window should be treated
  (after the arrow).

  To figure out to identify your window, you will need to use a
  command-line tool called "xprop". When you run xprop, your cursor
  will temporarily change to crosshairs; click on the window you
  want to identify. In the output that is printed in your terminal,
  look for a couple of things:
    - WM_CLASS(STRING): values in this list of strings can be compared
      to "className" to match windows.
    - WM_NAME(STRING): this value can be compared to "resource" to match
      windows.

  The className values tend to be generic, and might match any window or
  dialog owned by a particular program. The resource values tend to be
  more specific, and will be different for every dialog. Sometimes you
  might want to compare both className and resource, to make sure you
  are matching only a particular window which belongs to a specific
  program.

  Once you've pinpointed the window you want to manipulate, here are
  a few examples of things you might do with that window:
    - doIgnore: this tells xmonad to completely ignore the window. It will
      not be tiled or floated. Useful for things like launchers and
      trays.
    - doFloat: this tells xmonad to float the window rather than tiling
      it. Handy for things that pop up, take some input, and then go away,
      such as dialogs, calculators, and so on.
    - doF (W.shift "Workspace"): this tells xmonad that when this program
      is launched it should be sent to a specific workspace. Useful
      for keeping specific tasks on specific workspaces. In the example
      below I have specific workspaces for chat, development, and
      editing images.
